# This repository is for our accepted paper at NIPS CDNNRIA 
Our paper "Differentiable Fine-grained Quantization for Deep Neural Network Compression" is available online.
Please check out our [openreview discussion](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMdSQZtsX) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10351)

## Useful sources:
Since we haven't plan to release every code. Our code is based on the [quantization file](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/quantize) from Tensorflow.
